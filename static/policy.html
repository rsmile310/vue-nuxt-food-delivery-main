        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 2">
          All the information provided to Veehive by a User is voluntary. You
          understand that Veehive may use certain information of yours (a) for
          the purpose of providing you the Services, (b) for commercial purposes
          and in an aggregated or non-personally identifiable form for research,

          correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the
          change on our member information page or by contacting us. We will
          make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active

          information that is untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete (or

          reasonable grounds to suspect that the information provided by you is
          untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete, Veehive may, at its
          sole discretion, discontinue the provision of the Services to you.
          There may be circumstances where Veehive will not correct, delete or

          opinion data that is kept solely for evaluative purpose; and (b) the

          under any other law for the time being in force. After a period of
          time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held
          by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively,
          but our use of the anonymized data will be solely for analytic
          purposes. Please note that your withdrawal of consent, or cancellation
          of account may result in Veehive being unable to provide you with its
          Services or to terminate any existing relationship Veehive may have
          with you.

          Veehive may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer,
          debit card or cheque for Services for which amount(s) is/are payable.
          Veehive will collect such User’s credit card number and/or other
          financial institution information such as bank account numbers and
          will use that information for the billing and payment processes,
          including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such credit
          card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete
          such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however,
          is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication process.
          User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites
          of approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption,
          thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per current
          technology. However, Veehive provides you an option not to save your
          payment details. User is advised, however, that internet technology is
          not full proof safe and User should exercise discretion on using the
          same.

          The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s personally

          CHILDREN'S AND MINOR'S PRIVACY
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 2">
          Veehive strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise the
          online activities of their minor children and consider using parental
          control tools available from online services and software
          manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment.
          These tools also can prevent minors from disclosing their name,
          address, and other personally identifiable information online without
          parental permission. Although the Veehive Website and Services are not
          intended for use by minors, Veehive respects the privacy of minors who
          may inadvertently use the internet or the mobile application.
